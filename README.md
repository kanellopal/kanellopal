- 👋 Hi, I’m @kanellopal
- 👀 I’m interested in the ecology, functioning and agricultural/biotechnological applications on nitrogen cycling. This includes the discovery and robust assessment of novel Biological Nitrification Inhibitors,
enabling us to mitigate Nitrogen Use Efficiency loss, nitrate leaching and contamination, as well as nitrous oxide emmisions. I am interested also in the investigation of their mode of action on nitrifiers and putative off – target effects on important taxa for soil ecosystem functioning. 
Furthermore, I am interested in investigating processes influencing nitrous oxide fluxes (denitrification, nitrate ammonification, nitrifier denitrification, etc.) which determine whether a soil is a source or
sink of nitrous oxide.
Finally, I possess a keen interest in dealing with in vitro, in soil and in silico approaches to study aspects of the metabolism of microorganisms vital to nitrogen cycling, in particular ammonia oxidisers, 
and how it influences syntrophic or competitive interactions with other members in laboratory co-cultures and in natural microbial communities.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data analysis and visualisation in R, including handling large data volumes, applying descriptive statistics, and generating heatmaps and multivariate analysis plots
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on novel approaches for advancing our understanding and potential applications on aspects of the nitrogen cycle

- ⚽ Fun fact: I am a big PAOK FC and Liverpool FC fan
